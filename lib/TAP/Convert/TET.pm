=head1 NAME

TAP::Convert::TET - Convert TAP to TET

=head1 VERSION

This document describes TAP::Convert::TET version 0.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use TAP::Convert::TET;
    use TAP::Parser;
    
    # Output to STDOUT by default
    my $converter = TAP::Convert::TET->new;

    $converter->start;

    my $parser = TAP::Parser->new( { source => $fh } );
    $converter->convert( $parser, 'test' );

    $converter->end;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Simpleminded converter that turns TAP into a TET journal. See
L<http://tetworks.opengroup.org/> for more information about TET.

TET is used by the Linux Standard Base project. This module and the
associated tap2tet program are intended to help integrate Perl's tests
with LSB as part of an effort to incorporate Perl into LSB 3.2. See:

L<http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2007/05/msg124480.html>

for more information.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=over

=item C<< new( $options ) >>

Create a new C<< TAP::Convert::TET >>. Options may be passed as a hash:

    my @buffer = ( );
    # Capture output in an array
    my $converter = TAP::Convert::TET->new( { output => \@buffer } );

Available options are:

=over

=item C<output>

A filehandle, array reference or scalar reference to output the
generated TET journal to. If a filehandle (or object that has a print
method) is passed TET will be output to it. If a reference to an array
is provided lines of TET will be appended to the array. If a scalar
reference is provided the generated TET will be appended to the string.

Defaults to STDOUT.

=item C<< tcc_version >>

The version of C<tcc> to pretend to be. Defaults to '3.7a'.

=item C<< time_format >>

The format string to use for timestamps. Defaults to '%H:%M:%S'.

=item C<< datetime_format >>

The format string to use for date and time fields. Defaults to
'%H:%M:%S %Y%m%d'.

=item C<< program >>

The name of the program generating the TET output. Defaults to
'TAP::Convert::TET'.

=back

=item C<< start >>

Output the TET preamble. Call this before any calls to C<convert>.

=item C<< end >>

Output the TET postamble. Call this after any calls to C<convert>.

=item C<< convert( $parser, $name ) >>

Read test results from a C<TAP::Parser> instance and output them in TET
format. The optional C<$name> parameter may be used to provide the name
of the test script that was the original source of the results.

Convert may be called more than once to merge multiple TAP transcripts
into a single TET journal.

=item C<< write( $string ) >>

Write a line to the TET output stream. Internal use.

=item C<< tet( $code, $data, $text ) >>

Write a formatted TET journal entry to the output stream.

=back

=head2 Accessors

=over

=item C<< datetime_format >>

Get or set the format used for date/time strings.

=item C<< time_format >>

Get or set the time format.

=item C<< tcc_version >>

Get or set the version of C<tcc> we pretend to be.

=item C<< program >>

Get or set the program we pretend to be.

=item C<< sequence >>

Get or set the test sequence number.

=item C<< writer >>

Get or set the closure that is called to handle output.
